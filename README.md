## Important Notes

### Rate Limits

- **Recommended: Max 20-50 messages per day**
- The script includes random delays between messages (15-25 seconds)
- Start with a small test (5-10 messages) before sending to all
- Increase delays if you experience issues

### 2FA Handling
- If you have 2FA enabled, the script will pause and ask for your code
- Enter the 6-digit code in the terminal when prompted
- The script will then continue automatically

### Safety Features
- Multiple confirmation prompts before sending messages
- Option to limit the number of recipients
- All actions logged to `instagram_messenger.log`
- Random delays to avoid detection
- Secure password input (not visible when typing)

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small:** Test with 5-10 messages first
2. **Respect Limits:** Don't exceed 20-50 messages per day
3. **Use Natural Messages:** Avoid spam-like content
4. **Monitor Logs:** Check `instagram_messenger.log` for any issues
5. **Take Breaks:** Space out campaigns over multiple days
6. **Be Responsive:** If you get a warning from Instagram, STOP immediately

### Troubleshooting

**"ChromeDriver not found"**
- Install ChromeDriver (see setup instructions)
- Ensure it's in your PATH
- Try: `brew install chromedriver` on macOS

**"Login failed"**
- Check your credentials
- Make sure Instagram isn't blocking automated logins
- Try logging in manually first to verify credentials
- Check if Instagram requires you to verify your identity

**"Could not find 'Message' button"**
- The profile might be private
- The account might have messaging disabled
- You might not be following them

**"Failed to get following list"**
- Make sure you're logged in successfully
- Instagram UI might have changed (selectors may need updating)
- Try running the script again

**Account Issues**
- If Instagram detects automation, they may:
  - Show CAPTCHA challenges
  - Temporarily restrict your account
  - Require password reset
  - Permanently ban your account

## Logs

All activity is logged to `instagram_messenger.log` with timestamps and status for each message.

Example log output:
